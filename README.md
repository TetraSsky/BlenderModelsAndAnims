# About

###### The rights belong to these companies. The rigs I create are for educational purposes to learn how to use Blender !

## Getting Started

Please consider these few points before importing a project/model in Blender:

1. **Blender Version**: Blender 4.X or higher
2. **Requirements & Dependencies**: Some projects may require specific add-ons (Especially for animations). Check to make sure you read the "README" file if one is included with your download !
3. **Credit Me**: Even though I did not create these models (for some), I dedicate my free time to creating coherent and complete rigs, as well as animations. Tagging me and/or linking people to this GitHub repository always helps üòä !
